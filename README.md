# How to dupe:

---

- Open any GUI (Inventory/resource with inventory) With this mod enabled and the gui will pop up!

- "Delay Packets" Delays the packets being sent to the server successfully.
- "Send Packets" Stop packets being sent to the server for your actions.
- "Copy JSON" Copies your Json information to a file.
- "De-Sync" Closes a GUI Server-side but will keep it open for the player.
- "Close-Without-Packet" Is extremely useful as it will remove items from your inventory but the server will not understand where to put it.
- "Save-GUI" Saves your current GUI As It Is

There is an Auto-Dupe button where whenever you break a block it will send to the server that 2 blocks were broken! <!Unpatched!>

This Mod Is Not A Rat And Is Open Sourced And Free!
